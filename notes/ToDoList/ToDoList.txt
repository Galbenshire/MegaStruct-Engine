==== Things/Changes this engine will still need ====

- Rework entity respawning
    -- Instead of a `respawn` bool, an enum value that determines respawnability:
        --- Always capable of respawning
        --- Disable respawning when killed. Regain it during a section switch
        --- Destroy entity once killed. Despawning does not count
        --- Destroy entity once killed or despawned
    -- Custom spawn conditions (e.g. only appear if the camera is moving right)
- Checkpoint system
    -- Likely also means being able to tell when a level has started, and when it should end
- Items
    -- Picking them up
    -- Refilling health/ammo
    -- Preventin picked up items from respawning again
- Better Options Menu
- Actual Pause Menu
- Music
- Auto-Fire (higher priority)
- Velocity-altering gimmicks
    -- Conveyor Belts
    -- MM6 Springs
    -- Wind
    -- etc.
- Save File System
- Lives System
- More player weapons
    -- How to do shields for this engine?
- Rework lockstack system
    -- Rather than "adding & removing" locks, think of the locks as more like switches
